# Analysis of 311 data

- Labeling and tagging the data for running regression models ( Create soft edges by correlating it with possible  rationale for why this is happening - zoning laws, 911 calls etc )
1- Structuring the data like a graph so you can link similar complaints ( Graphql , neo4j, orientdb ) with the same timespan/back in history(archived complaints )
-  Apart from people in the city complaining, have a pre-incident 311, like minority report where based on  sensor data/people live reporting/tweeting, you proactively create 311 issues to be tackled and then see how that correlates with the consumer complaints
- Enable some kind of VR, AR for the dataset
- Using IBM watson for deep learning
- Analyze unresolved/open complaints. why did it happen and how can it be avoided /change schema?
- Analyze erroneous complaints and see how that can be marked in the story/complaint
- Analyze cost of solving a complaint - end to end ( perhaps add cost to the column )
