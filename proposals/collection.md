# Collecting 311 data

- Calling the complain - a story ( look at the github issue comparison )
- what would  be useful to know is how this 311 data is picked off the queue for processing? Who manages the workflow of the 311 call?
- Change how a 311 call is taken? How is the script/structure of what should be asked and filled out to be decided?
- Gathering more data around the incident
- Adding voice recognition/voice sampling data
- Gathering feedback on the complaint ( response times, who actioned upon it, how long did the process take, what approvals/steps needed to be taken, which departments had to work together, what were the bureaucratic hurdles etc  )
- Capturing information from social networks ( tweets to @311, posts on 311 fb site, snapchats, instas etc )
- Supporting images and attachments with the request
- See if the individual columns have the necessary attributes or they need to be expanded ( like types of complaints, types of .... etc )
- Get basic demographic information about the person making the complaint ( keeping privacy in account )
- Smartphone app to collect the data or texting to 311or having a web portal to get data or having Chatbot/Surveymonkey/Typeform to collect 311's
- Each complaint should be a story and not a line item. Each complaint should have things like avatars, people in charge/involved, stickers, comments, reactions ,photos, attachments, etc. ( Like a github graphql schema, links to other issues. This should be like gitlab/github issues page )
